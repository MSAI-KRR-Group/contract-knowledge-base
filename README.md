# contract-knowledge-base

## About

* What happens when you make a knowledge base from a set of contracts?
* In this project, we build a knowledge base of popular licenses that people use with GitHub Repositories
* The representation of each licence's goals are based on GitHub's interpretation
* This project in no way represents actual advice, just an exercise in Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
